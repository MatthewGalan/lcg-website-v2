This is the React app for [loricaprongalan.com](https://www.loricaprongalan.com). This is a portfolio website for my mom, made by me.

There is an admin portal which allows her to upload new pieces, edit titles/descriptions/etc, and rearrange pieces. Images and descriptions are hosted on AWS S3 and DynamoDB, respectively. The backend is a spaghetti mess of lambdas and API Gateway (not doing that again lol).

Seriously, she's an amazing artist, so check out her work at [loricaprongalan.com](https://www.loricaprongalan.com) (and admire the well engineered website). If you find a bug or manage to break something, send me an email at matthewgalan1@gmail.com. Thanks!
